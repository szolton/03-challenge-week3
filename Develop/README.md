# Password Generator Starter Code

The purpose of this project was to make a random password generator. 

You can use this project by loading up the password generator, selecting the criteria you want included in the password, copy the password to your clipboard, and it automatically generates a random password.

This youtube video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duNmhKgtcsI was a super helpful resource in helping break down the requirements and what I had to do to successfully meet the criteria for the challenge. It really helped me understand event listeners and how to work with basic JavaScript.

You can see in this screenshot the checked boxes that the elements you want to include in your random password. You can also adjust the password length to be between 8-128 characters and choose how long you want the password to be.
